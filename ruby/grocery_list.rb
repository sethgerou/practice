## Method to create a list
# input: string of items separated by spaces (example: "carrots apples cereal pizza")
# steps:
  # create a hash
  # set default quantity (1)
  # print the list to the console - method to print the list
# output: print list
def create_list(items)
  list = {}
  items.split(" ").each {|item| list[item] = 1}
  list
end

# Method to add an item to a list
# input: list, item name, and optional quantity
# steps: add item name => quanitity to hash
# output: print list
def add_item(list, item, quantity=1)
  update_item_quantity(list, item, quantity)
end

# Method to remove an item from the list
# input: list, item name
# steps: delete item name from list hash
# output: print list
def remove_item(list, item)
  list.delete(item)
  list
end

# Method to update the quantity of an item
# input: list, item name, quanity
# steps: update the value of the the key item name in list hash
# output: item name quanity updated
def update_item_quantity(list, item, quantity)
  list[item] = quantity
  list
end

# Method to PRINT A LIST and make it look pretty
# input: list (hash)
# steps: for each item/quanity print a line like Item: quantity
# output: print the hash

RELEASE 4 - REFLECTION

- pseudocode - useful to think about input, output, and steps for each method. In a more complicated program, it's probalby useful to spend time pseudocoding each step to implement the desired functionality in a method.

- tradeoffs - using a hash allows for the storing of a quantity for each item name.  implementing with an items array and a quanitites array, but it would be clunky.

- a method returns the value of the last operation.  The program we wrote doesn't make use of the returns of the methods - because we call the print_list method at the end of most of them.

- method arguements may be variables, values, or other methods (the return of the method is passed as an arguement to the called method)

- information can be passed between methods via arguements - not sure I undertand the question beyond that.

- I have a better sense of how to tackle pseudocoding listing out the inputs and outputs and to describe the steps needed to implement the functionality.  I'd like to maybe refactor the program to make use of each method's return value, or to redo the print method to be more versatile.
